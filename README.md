## General info
This project is simple search engine for alkoholic cocktails.
The project contains five buttons. 
Two (a picture of a drink and a random button) are used to display a random cocktail. 
After clicking, you can find information such as: ingredients, recipe and a preview photo.
The next buttons are: searching by ingredients (e.g. vodka), by name (e.g. margarita), 
and the entire list of available drinks (in this case only 100 elements - that's what the API allows)
